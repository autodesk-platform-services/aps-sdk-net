# Contributing to APS SDK

We work hard to provide an excellent SDK for the Autodesk community, and we greatly appreciante your feedback and contributions. Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests. 

For general questions (_how to_), please use the [APS Get Help](https://aps.autodesk.com/get-help) form. We strongly encourage using [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/autodesk-platform-services).

## Before you start

- **Search before you file a new Issue or Pull Request**. Add to tickets if you have new information about the issue.
- **Keep it short but complete**. Make sure you include all the context needed to solve the problem.

## Issues

- **Bug Report**: if you believe you encounter a problem using any of the APS SDKs, please create a new issue with enough information to reproduce the issue (e.g. code snippet that triggers the problem). Please review existing issues before starting a new.

- **Feature Request**: please use the [APS Public Roadmap](https://aps.autodesk.com/aps-roadmap) instead.

## Pull Request

Pull Requests are the best way to propose changes to the APS SDK code. Always use `main` branch as a starting point (we do our best to keep that up to date with published versions). Please use [fork & pull](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#fork--pull).

Please use a **Title** that summarizes the proposal, and a **Description** with a complete description of what it does and list of changes implemented. The APS team will triage, review, and if aplicable, merge into the appropriate `dev` branch.
